  <p>The Hidden Cost of Urban Expansion on Wildlife</p>
</header>

<main>
  <section>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
      This project explores how urban expansion affects wild animals in and near city environments. It focuses on behavioral and health changes due to light and noise pollution, diet alterations, and species adaptability. The goal is to inform the public about how urban life impacts wildlife through accessible, science-based content.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How do urban noise and light pollution affect animals like songbirds and bats?</li>
      <li>Why do species like pigeons and squirrels thrive, while others decline?</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Literature Highlights</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>Adaptation vs. Decline:</strong> Some carnivores like raccoons adapt to city life (Bateman & Fleming, 2012), while sensitive species vanish.</p>
      <p><strong>Pollution Stress:</strong> Light and noise disrupt feeding and mating, lowering survival rates in songbirds (Riley et al., 2020).</p>
      <p><strong>Traits of Survivors:</strong> Urban survivors show flexibility and boldness, but face higher risks of disease and accidents (McCleery et al., 2014).</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Strategy</h2>
    <p>
      The website will feature engaging species profiles, maps, and infographics to make research more digestible. It will summarize scholarly studies and present comparisons between thriving and struggling wildlife.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>
      By translating scientific data into public knowledge, this project encourages urban dwellers to adopt more wildlife-friendly habits. It serves as a resource for educators, conservationists, and anyone interested in understanding how city life shapes the natural world.
